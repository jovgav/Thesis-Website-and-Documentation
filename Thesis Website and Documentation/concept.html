        <div class="content">This thesis is a poetic exploration of my bedroom, particularly as a representation of a personal history, using objects as language for what I deem a "physical memoir". This bedroom-as-metaphor is an abstract guideline, in order to explore the idea that that which makes us human is an ephemeral, undefinable essence, one which can be, in part, realized through the objects that we collect, and what they represent about us. I will be engaging with 3D scanning, printing, projection mapping, scale, and written language as a way to explore duplication, replication, and technology as an artistic mode of storytelling, rather than an industrial and utilitarian process. It is here that this project diverges from a typical archive, as these objects will not be the collected items themselves, but rather manipulations of such objects, creating a "duplication archive" through 3D printing. The intended goal of this project is to explore a modern purview of "memoir" through object replica, as I believe duplication is one of the major focal points of both art and technology, though the stakes of replication differs starkly depending on which of these two lenses one wishes to engage with. I hope to provide a thesis which posits duplication as a valid and poetic mode of artistic engagement.</div>
